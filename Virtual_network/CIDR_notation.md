# What is CIDR Notation?
- CIDR (Classless Inter-Domain Routing) notation is a compact method for specifying IP addresses and their routing suffixes.
- For example, we can express the idea that the IP address 192.168. 0.1 is associated with the netmask 255.255. 255.0 by using the 
  CIDR notation of 192.168.29-Jun-2021
