# What is Subnet?
```
- A subnet, or subnetwork, is a network inside a network. 
- Subnets make networks more efficient. 
- Through subnetting, network traffic can travel a shorter distance without passing through unnecessary routers to reach its destination.
- Shares a subnet of the vnets IP range.
- Is a must. Resources must be placed in a subnet, cannot placed directly in the vnet.
- Subnets are free. 
- Limits of 3,000 subnets per vnet.
